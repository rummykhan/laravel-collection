# Laravel Collection

This is a standalone version of `laravel/collection` to use in any php project.

### Motivation
Since I've been using laravel extensively and later moved to other php 
frameworks i.e. Symfony and Yii. There are times when you have to manipulate
arrays extensively and it's too painful without `laravel/collection`. 
So I extracted the `laravel/collection` for standalone use. Hope it helps.

### Install using composer

```php
composer require rummykhan/laravel-collection
```

### How To

To create a collection object you can use either of two ways.

1. Using `RummyKhan\Collection\Collection::make($arr)`
2. Using laravel `collect($arr)` method.
